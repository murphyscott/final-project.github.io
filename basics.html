  <h2>General Policies</h2>
  <p>There are different types of policies that when elected, certain officals act on. These policies can range from social to economic to environmental. However, for the 2020 election there were eight key issues that took the spotlight: cornavirus, climate, economy, health care, foreign policy, race and policing, guns, and the supreme court. Your political party affiliation will depend on your opinions reguarding these topics. </p>
  <h2>Electoral College</h2>
  <p>Do you ever hear this term and just nod along so you don’t look dumb? Well that is okay becasue now you are going to learn about it! The Electoral College was established in 1789 by the U.S. Congress as an alternative to popular election. The electoral college was a precaution to balance out uneducated voters. 
Each state, depending on its population, receives a certain amount of electoral votes. For example, bigger states like California have 55 electors whereas smaller states such as Vermont only have three electors. In total there are 538 electors for all 50  states. Once voting has concluded, the state will either be categorized as a red (republican) or blue (democrat) state. Let’s say 70% of caliornia voted blue and 30% voted red, then their 55 electoral votes would go towards the democratic candidate. 
In order to win the election a candidate must receive 270 votes or more. How many electoral votes does your state have?
